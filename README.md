# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Firebase setup & sharing with teammates

1. Create a Firebase project (or reuse the existing `allora-serice-hub` project) and enable **Authentication** and **Cloud Firestore** in the Firebase console.
2. In the Firebase console, go to **Project settings → General → Your apps**, copy the web app config, and place the values inside a local `.env` file using the keys shown in `.env.example`. Never commit your real secrets.
3. Start the dev server with `npm start`; `src/firebase.js` automatically consumes the `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_*` variables and exposes the initialized `auth` and `db` instances for the rest of the app.
4. To let teammates see the same “tables” (Firestore collections), add them as project members in **Project settings → Users and permissions** with at least the `Viewer` role or a custom role that grants Firestore read/write.
5. Ask teammates to copy `.env.example` to their own `.env`, fill in the shared config, run `npm install` (first time only), and then `npm start`. They will point at the same Firebase backend, so any Firestore collections/documents you create become immediately visible to everyone with access.

If you need to inspect collection data together, open **Firestore Database → Data** in the Firebase console—changes appear in real time for all collaborators.
